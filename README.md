## Description:

Spoilers! Spoilers everywhere!

TVMuse.com is a website devoted to allowing users to watch TV shows through their own free links. However, TVMuse has recently disallowed users from submitting their own video links. This resulted in users putting their video links into the comment section for an episode instead. However, discussion in the comment section usually contains spoilers of the episode, so searching for user submitted links is a very dangerous task, until now.

TVMuse Comment Blocker parses every episode page you visit on TVMuse.com and automatically censors out possible spoilers from the comment section. The result is a spoiler free comment section that you can navigate to look for links.

In addition, the summary section is also blocked in case the page creator was feeling extra-dubious, and revealed too much information.
